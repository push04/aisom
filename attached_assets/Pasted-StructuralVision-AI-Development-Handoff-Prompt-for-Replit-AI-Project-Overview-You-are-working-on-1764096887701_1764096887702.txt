Backend: Netlify Functions (OpenRouter proxy, Geocoding proxy)
Charts: Recharts
Maps: OpenStreetMap (iframe embed)
Deployment: Netlify (configured)
Current State

Dashboard - Overview cards, recent analyses (localStorage persistence)
Crack Analyzer - Image upload, segmentation simulation, section loss calculations, AI explanations
Beam Deflection - Advanced calculator with:
3 beam types (Simply Supported, Cantilever, Fixed-Fixed)
3 load types (Point, UDL, Triangular)
3 diagram modes (Deflection, Moment, Shear)
Material database (8 materials: steel, aluminum, concrete, timber, FRP)
Export features (JSON, Text Report, Copy to Clipboard)
Ergonomics - Webcam pose detection, risk assessment, back load calculations
Site Context - Weather data (Open-Meteo), OSM map, location search
🔧 Infrastructure
Error boundaries on all pages
Material database utility (
src/utils/materials.js
)
Unit conversion utility (
src/utils/unitConversion.js
)
Export utilities (
src/utils/exportUtils.js
)
Netlify Functions for backend (netlify/functions/)
🐛 Known Issues
AI features (Explain Results buttons) don't work in npm run dev - require Netlify deployment
Geocoding search requires Netlify deployment
Camera permissions need HTTPS for production
